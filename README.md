## Simple Bubble Sort in C++

This is a basic C++ program that demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

### How to Use

1. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.

2. Run the compiled program.

3. Enter 10 integers when prompted, and the program will sort them in ascending order using Bubble Sort.

### Code Explanation

- The program starts by declaring an integer array and populating it with user input.
- The `sort` function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array.
- Elements are compared and swapped within the array as needed until the array is sorted.
- The sorted array is displayed to the user.
